# Day 8 ‚Äì Fullstack Feedback Submission App (React + Node.js)

This project is part of my 150-day developer preparation journey, marking the beginning of Week 2 with fullstack architecture and real-world API handling. On Day 8, I built a complete feedback flow that connects a React form to an Express backend using Axios.

## ‚úÖ What I Practiced:

- Controlled form inputs with validation and error handling
- Axios-based POST requests from React frontend
- Backend route creation in Express.js for feedback submission
- Parsing JSON request bodies using middleware
- Form state management and conditional rendering of response
- Clean UI composition with Tailwind CSS

## üß† Key Concepts Covered:

- API integration: frontend to backend data flow
- Cross-origin request handling and headers
- Form UX patterns: disable button on error, show success/failure
- Express route setup: POST /api/feedback with payload logging
- Modular folder structure for frontend and backend separation

## üõ† Features:

- Name, Email, Message fields with validation
- Error messages for empty or invalid inputs
- Submits data to backend and receives response
- Success message or toast on valid submission
- Responsive layout using Tailwind utility classes
- Optional JSON saving to mock file or in-memory DB

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack:

- React.js (functional components + hooks)
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Node.js + Express for backend server
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- JavaScript validation and state control

## üî• Why This Matters:

Product interviews often go beyond just UI ‚Äî they test your ability to manage real-world data, APIs, error states, and backend logic. This app simulates a common use case found in dashboards, SaaS platforms, and customer support flows.

Day 8 complete. Backend + frontend stitched together with intention and flow. Ready to scale into deeper fullstack challenges next.
